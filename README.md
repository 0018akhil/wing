# @wingconsole/monorepo

> This repository uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), a fast, disk space efficient package manager. Instead of using `npm` in the command line, you can just use `pnpm`.
>
> If you want to always run the same package manager, you can use [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#readme). It reads your project configuration and uses npm, pnpm, yarn or bun automatically.
>
> Additionally, this repository uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for cacheable and parallelizable job orchestration.
