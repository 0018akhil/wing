# The Wing language

This strives to be a complete [wing](https://github.com/monadahq/rfcs/pull/4) language implementation. It's a WIP.

The project currently includes the [wingc](./wingc) compiler.

In the (near?) future we expect an implementation of the [POCIX standard library](https://github.com/monadahq/rfcs/pull/10) to sit here too or at least the wing bindings to it.
